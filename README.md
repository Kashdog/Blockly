# Data Rules Editor

This is IBM's method of rule creation using Google's Blockly, a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to create rules.

To view the Data Rule demo go to https://github.com/Kashdog/Blockly/blob/master/demos/DataClassification%26Rules/DataRules.html

To run the demo:

1. Click the Choose File button next to Load Palette and Choose the File DataRuleFunctionsLibrary.xml from the demos folder

This will allow the code to read from the file and generate all the function and test blocks in the palette

To parse a Rule into Blocks:

First make sure Step 1 has been done.

Enter your rule into the input box next to "Rule Expression to Convert to Blocks:"


Click the Choose File button next to Generate Blocks and Choose the File DataRuleFunctionsLibrary.xml from the demos folder

This will load the workspace with the Rule you entered converted into Block Format
